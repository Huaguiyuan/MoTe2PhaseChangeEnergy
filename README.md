# Github repository for MoTe2 phase change energy consumption paper

This repo contains all data and plotting files needed to generate the
figures found in 

```
Rehn, D.A., Li, Y., & Reed, E.J. Theoretical potential for low energy consumption phase change memory utilizing
electrostatically-induced structural phase transitions in 2D materials. (in preparation).
```

We include 3 top-level directories:

- `data`: All input files and scripts related to generating data
  needed for figures.
- `figures`: Scripts used to generate figures in the paper. The
  scripts reference the data in the `data` directory directly (no data
  is provided in the `figures` folder.
- `table`: Provides a python file for computing numbers that are found
  in the table of the paper.
