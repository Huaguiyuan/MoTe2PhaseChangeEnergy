# SI Figure 3

This figure relies on the data in

`data/thermal_properties/phonon`

and

`data/thermal_properties/electron/uncharged`,

specifically the `thermal.dat` files in the `2H` and `1Tp`
directories of the `phonon` folder and the `entropy.dat` file in the
`electron` folder.

To generate this figure, run

``` bash
$ python sifig3.py
```
